Moreover, since $M$ and $N$ are the midpoints of the segments $B C$ and $P Q$ respectively, then the triangles $A Q N$ and $H B M$ are also similar.

But, as $D A$ is the diameter of the circumcirle of $A B C$, the condition that $\\\\angle D L A=90^{\\\\circ}$ is enough to conclude that $L$ belongs on the circumcircle of $A B C$.\\n\\nRemark. There is a spiral similarity mapping $A Q P$ to $H B C$. Since the similarity maps $A N$ to $H M$, it also maps $A H$ to $N M$, and since these two lines are parallel, the centre of the similarity is $L=A N \\\\cap H M$. Since the similarity maps $B C$ to $Q P$, its centre belongs on the circumcircle of $B C X$, where $X=B Q \\\\cap P C$.

Thus, $C$ is the intersection of the circle $k_1$ with center $B$ and radius $b$, and the Apollonius circle $k_2$ corresponding to the points $A_1$ and $A$ and the ratio $b/c$; in the case $b=c$, the perpendicular bisector of $AA_1$ is to be used. It is sufficient to take one of the intersection points, as the other gives a quadrilateral symmetric to $AA_1$.\\n\\nFinally, we measure the angle $\\\\angle ACB$ at $C$ on the opposite side of the line $AC$ from $B$, and the angle $\\\\angle CAB$ at $A$ on the side containing $B$, the intersection of their sides is $D$.\\n\\nThe quadrilateral $ABCD$, if it exists, meets the conditions because it is convex, and furthermore, $\\\\triangle ADC \\\\sim \\\\triangle A_1BC$ because their corresponding angles are equal, so\\n\\n$$\\nAD = \\\\frac{AC}{A_1C} \\\\cdot A_1B = \\\\frac{c}{b} \\\\cdot d \\\\cdot \\\\frac{b}{c} = d, \\\\quad CD = \\\\frac{AC}{A_1C} \\\\cdot CB = \\\\frac{c}{b} \\\\cdot b = c\\n$$\\n\\nand $AB = a, BC = b$ by construction.

Consider the decimal representation of the original four-digit number $n=\\\\overline{a b c d}$, then $R(n)=\\\\overline{d c b a}=4 n+3$ is also a four-digit number.

Substituting the found values into the equation from the condition: $R(n)=4 \\\\cdot \\\\overline{a b c d}+3=4031+400 b+40 c=7001+100 c+10 b$, from which $13 b-2 c=99$.

We call three lattice points \"good\" if this condition holds for them.\\n\\nWe will show that the statement in the problem is true for natural numbers greater than 8.

These possibilities are contained in the table of Figure 1.\\n\\nNow consider 9 lattice points and place them in the cells of Figure 1 according to the remainders of their coordinates when divided by 3. If there is a cell with at least three points, then we are done, since the sum of three equal remainders is divisible by 3.\\n\\nIf there is no cell with more than two points, then at least 5 cells must contain lattice points, since the number of points is 9. Select five such \"occupied\" cells, and one point from each of these cells. We claim that among these there are three good points.\\n\\nClearly, for any two different cells, there is exactly one third cell such that the three points in these three cells are good, so there are $\\\\binom{9}{2} / 3=12$ such good triples where the elements are from different cells.\\n\\nNow consider the $\\\\binom{5}{2}=10$ good triples determined by the 5 selected lattice points. If we can show that these triples cannot all be different, then we are done, since two different pairs of points define the same good triple if and only if the points of the two pairs are the same, and thus all three points are among the given points.\\n\\nTo do this, divide the 12 good triples into four groups of three elements each, as shown in Figure 2.

However, within each group, no two triples share a point, so it would take 6 points to define the three triples in one group! Since we only have 5 points, the 10 triples must indeed have some that are the same, from which it follows that the statement of the problem is true for 9 points.\\n\\nAn example of an 8-element counterexample is the following:\\n\\n$$\\n(0 ; 0),(0 ; 0),(0 ; 1),(0 ; 1),(1 ; 0),(1 ; 0),(1 ; 1),(1 ; 1)\\n$$\\n\\nPoints fall into four cells, two in each (Figure 3a), and clearly there are no three good points among them.

The restriction in the problem that no three of the given points lie on the same line was not essential, as long as we interpret the centroid of a degenerate triangle as the arithmetic mean of the coordinates of its vertices.\\n\\n2. The problem is a \"two-dimensional\" generalization of the well-known statement that among five integers, there are always three whose sum is divisible by 3. Essentially, we showed that among nine pairs of integers, there are always three such that the sum of both the first and the second elements is divisible by 3. The problem can clearly be further generalized. On the other hand, the \"one-dimensional\" statement is a special case of the following theorem: if there are $2 n-1$ integers, then there are always exactly $n$ that can be selected such that their sum is divisible by $n$.
